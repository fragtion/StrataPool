// include/strata/pool/link.hpp - the pool's coordinator side: the workers, and the head that runs here.
//
// The coordinator's own verifier and prompt path run layers [0, K1) and stop there (`Verifier::set_link`,
// `Prefill::remote_next`).  PoolLink carries their hand-off to each worker in turn (a star: coordinator -> worker 1
// -> coordinator -> worker 2 ...; with the usual two PCs that is one hop out and one back) and brings the final
// residual home, where it runs the output head and the sampler (the same kernels the verify window's head records)
// and keeps the final rows where the draft layer (MTP) reads them.  The drafter, the sampler and every decision of
// the serve loop therefore stay on the coordinator, exactly as with one GPU; a worker is a pure function of the
// rows it gets and of its own layers' state.
